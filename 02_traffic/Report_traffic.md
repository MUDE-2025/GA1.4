# Report Traffic Dataset

## Questions

**Question 1**

Give a short description of the provided dataset in statistical terms, based on the tasks in the notebook. Visualize the data and choose a parametric distribution function for each variable between the indicated ones: choose between a **lognormal** and **exponential** distribution to model the vehicle flow, and between a **Gaussian** and **Gumbel** distribution for the average velocity. Justify your choice based on the previous description and visualization. 

_You should describe your data with only a few sentences, and be sure to use quantitative information! Refer to that description to choose the parametric distribution function. You can also include some plots that may support your reasoning._

_Distribution chosen for **<VARIABLE_1>**:_ **your distribution here.**

_Your justification here._

_Distribution chosen for **<VARIABLE_2>**:_ **your distribution here.**

_Your justification here._



**Question 2**

Fit and assess the goodness of fit of the selected parametric distribution functions to the dataset. Use (at least) Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and one graphical technique. For the graphical technique, choose between the QQplot and logscale plot. Describe in a few sentences how the chosen parametric distribution functions performs.

_Remember to use quantitative information based on the goodness of fit metrics that you have used. Also, you can include some examples of the differences in the computed and observed non-exceedance probabilities._



**Question 3**

Propagate the uncertainty through the equation to estimate the traffic density, $D$, using both observations and simulated samples. Provide a bulleted list that summarizes differences between the two obtained distributions.

- list

Compare the simulated samples and observations $(F,v)$ in a scatter plot, then prepare a bulleted list that describes the differences. Is there anything you could improve in the analysis? Provide with recommendations to improve the performed analysis. They can be both about the univariate distributions and about the propagation of uncertainty method you have used.

_Include your figure here. Be sure to use high contrast data symbols/colors and a legend to differentiate the two data sets clearly._




**Last Question: How did things go? (Optional)**

_Use this space to let us know if you ran into any challenges while working on this GA, and if you have any feedback to report._
